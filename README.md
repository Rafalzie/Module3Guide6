The UI Framework in the Figma Hi-Fi prototype was used to standardize components such as buttons, form fields, and navigation elements across the design, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
 By leveraging pre-built components and styles from the framework, the design process became faster, as repetitive tasks like setting up grids, typography, and color schemes were automated. 
It also allowed for easier updates and modifications, as changes made to a single component were reflected across the entire prototype.
 Additionally, using the framework reduced the chance of errors or inconsistencies, streamlining both design and development handoff. 
Overall, the UI Framework significantly simplified the workflow, enhancing productivity and ensuring a cohesive user experience.
